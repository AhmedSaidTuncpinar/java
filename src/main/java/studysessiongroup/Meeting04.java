    1.What are the advantages of “inheritance” ?
    1) Reusability 2) Maintenance 3) Less code
    1)We use "inheritance";
        i)to prevent "repetition"
        ii)to make "maintenance" easy
        iii)to make our classes "atomic"

    2.What is the syntax to create a parent class for a class ?

    public class Child extends Parent { }

     To make a class child of another class we use "extends" keyword


    3.Which access modifiers can be inherited ?

    public and protected class members can be inherited, private ones cannot.

    default ones can be if they are in the same package

    4.What is the difference between super() and this()

    super() is used to call parent constructor, this() is used to call in class constructor.

    5.  What is the difference between super() and super ?

    super() is used to call parent constructor, super is used to call parent class variables and methods.

    6) Which of the followings are true about inheritance in Java?

    A) In Java, all classes inherit from the Object class/T
    B) In Java, all classes have parent class except Object class/T
    C) public and protected class members can be inherited without any issue/T
    D) default class members cannot be inherited/F

    7)
    public class A { }
    public class B extends A { }
    public class C extends B { }
    Which ones are true?
    A) C IS-A B / T
    B) C IS-A A / T
    C) B HAS-A C / T
    D) A HAS-A C / T

      8)Which ones are true?
            A) If X IS-A Y then X is sub class of Y and Y is super class of X / True

            B) If X HAS-A Y then X is super class of Y and Y is sub class of X / True

            C) If X IS-A Y and Y HAS-A Z but Z is not or has not X then X and Z are siblings / True

            D) If X IS-A Y and Z HAS-A X but Y is not or has not Z then Java does not support that relationship

            9)public class A { }
         public class B extends A { }
        public class C extends B { }
        Which ones are true?
        A) A and B are 2 super classes /True
        B) B and C are sub classes / True
        C) This is multi level inheritance / True
        D) Java does not support that kind of inheritance /False


    10)Which ones are true to compare Overloading with Overriding?
    A) For Overloading, method signature must be different but for Overriding method signature
    must be same. /True
    B) static, private, and final methods cannot be overridden but they can be overloaded. / True
    C) For Overriding, we need inheritance but for Overloading we do not need inheritance / True
    D) For Overriding and Overloading, we have to modify codes inside the method body. / True
